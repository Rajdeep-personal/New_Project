# New_Project
Now a days heart disease or cardio viscular disease is a very common problem that can be found amongst the people of different ages. In this project the main objective was to classify people between two classes having heart disease and not having heart disease.
Based on this classification, the diseased people can get good treatment. Among all the classification metrics , here our prime object should be focussed on Recall or True Positive Prediction Rate.
Higher this score better the model will be able to identify those people who are truly having Heart Disease.
