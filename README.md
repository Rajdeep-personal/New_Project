# New_Project
Now a days heart disease or cardio viscular disease is a very common problem that can be found amongst the people of different ages. India has one of the highest burdens of Cardioviscular Disease(CVD). The annual number of deaths from CVD in India is projected to rise from 2.26 million (1990) to 4.77 million (2020). Coronary heart disease prevalence rates in India have been estimated over the past several decades and have ranged from 1.6% to 7.4% in rural populations and from 1% to 13.2% in urban population.
In this project the main objective was to classify people between two classes having heart disease and not having heart disease.
Based on this classification, the diseased people can get good treatment. Among all the classification metrics , here our prime object should be focussed on Recall or True Positive Prediction Rate. Not only that but we also can check which algorithm gives lower amount of misclassification i.e, the correctly classified percentage is higher . If the correctly classified percentage is high we can take that model also.
Higher this score better the model will be able to identify those people who are truly having Heart Disease.
